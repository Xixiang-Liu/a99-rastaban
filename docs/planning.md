# Planning

# Project - COVID Dashboard
We'll probably go for a COVID dashboard, but considering a personal health information management app or disability advocacy platform.

    Reasonable features:
    -Web-scraped live data that's relevant to COVID cases
    -CDC information embedded
    -Fully functional login/signup features
    -Decent looking themed interface

# Meetings
No solid schedule setup but we're going to try and meet once a week until the final couple of weeks, then meet twice a week until we finish up. Either on zoom or in-person. Group chat was set up for communication.
